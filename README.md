# URL_Paster-Miro

This script is a petition of my colleage Antonio from factory planification department.

In the factory planification department use a board MIRO to manage the work flow, the position of the machine in the factory and his assembly progress.
Antonio needed can access into the "sábana" of each machine to know the work quantity remains to do. For it i created a script wich make a query if in the last 30 minutes the quality inspector has created new sábana.
If it was created, then the script must to search the "sticky note" in MIRO match with the order number in the sábana, if we have match so the script paste the url of the sábana into the "sticky note".

That is good because he can continue using MIRO and nothing else and this allow him review quickly which is the progress of work of each machine and to planning better the work journey.

**A sábana example bellow:**
![Rework list example](https://github.com/morawer/rework_study/blob/master/Readme_images/rework_list.jpg?raw=true)

This sábanas are pasted in the machine with the "to do's" remains to make in the unit. 


**A sticky note example bellow:**

If the order number made match in Miro will embed the URL to quick query by Antonio.
